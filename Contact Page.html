                For Walking Softly.<br>
                Miss you, brother.<br>

            <p class="p1"><i>Beautiful Boy</i></p>
    
            <p class="p4">On the day of the funeral, your mom said you called her. She said that there was the most perfect
                pink cloud in
                the dawn sky, and she knew it was you. This beautiful boy, bright and buoyant, wanted to watch the sunrise
                with
                her.</p>
    
            <p class="p4">I went and visited you in your plot in Richmond not too long ago. I was headed to Cole and Henry’s
                and made a
                detour. Met with your mom, and sister Hannah. I don’t know where the rest of your family was, but we talked
                and
                cried and laughed. Nobody had answers still, and that had not settled in. Nobody knew how to live with that.
                So
                we looked back to find them, in that dusty old closet for dead relatives in the basement, the kind that
                stores
                memories like that. It wasn’t dusty enough, and each box looked looted, searched through. There was no
                apparent
                guilty party, but the thought was that it might've been a little bit of everyone; taking pieces of what was
                left.</p>
    
            <p class="p4">We just wanted to see you, really. And we did. We saw all these colors and shapes and beautiful
                shiny things.</p>
    
            <p class="p4">I saw you, fingerpainting with your sister when you were little. A gross little monster with
                purple and green
                fingers, with a toothless grin that beamed like rays of sunshine. And you in a swim diaper, not so secretly
                peeing in the pool, even before that.</p>
    
            <p class="p4">I saw the private keeps. The ones that made me feel like an imposter for claiming to love you, the
                kind only a
                parent understands, like a failed chemistry test. When your mom saw it she laughed. Said you were a natural
                chemist, but failed it to spite her. She didn't love the idea of you going to art school. I remember talking
                to
                you about it. Not what was said, but how mad you were. You had anger to spare.</p>
    
            <p class="p4">Your mom insisted I see your eighth-year art project. It was alright. I didn’t know that you were
                ever religious. I’m
                actually pretty sure you weren’t.</p>
    
            <div class="img"><img src="JOBEAU2.jpg" alt="Joeseph Beauregard"></div> <br>
    
            <p class="p4">I saw the first picture of you and Cole, in tenth grade, before we’d met. I heard the proofs rap
                you two made
                for geometry class in the audio lab at school. I’m glad it isn't getting a posthumous release.</p>
    
            <p class="p4">We didn’t find any answers, and your sister left after seeing the third picture of you.</p>
    
            <p class="p4">The search left your mom in a sunken silence. I was angry, sort of.</p>
    
            <p class="p4">How unbelievably self-centered you were. None of it made any sense, emotionally, or logistically.
                There was no
                reasoning, no inciting incident. You were Hannah’s snot-nose kid brother. Your mother's beautiful boy.</p>
    
            <p class="p1"><i>Waxing Poetic</i></p>
    
            “I fucking hate those words, man.”
    
            <p class="p4">Smiling, posed, a human gargoyle in a Gold Notre Dame hoodie, Joe hunched over the marble edge,
                eyes falling to
                the street. Halfway up the Burgin Center for the Arts, we’re high, I’m high and fucking freezing. Tonight is
                freezing and I’m afraid of heights. I am paint-smeared, happy. Staring straight up at stars much closer than
                the
                street.</p>
    
            “Have you read How I Found Livingstone?”
    
            <p class="p4">I’ve got an essay on Catcher in the Rye due Wednesday.</p>
    
            “Nobody has, it isn’t important. Morton, the author, is a dickhead. Give me the dab pen - but he wrote that. Wax
            poetic. Weirdly, it was the 1800’s. You think ‘beat poet’ when you hear it...
    
            right?”
    
            <p class="p4">High society 1800’s? Or Oliver Twist?</p>
    
            “He’s a sir.”
    
            <p class="p4">Pompous. But beats are too. Don’t know all of them, and I love Dharma Bums, but that comes with
                the territory.
                Maybe I’m projecting, I am projecting, but attempts at unpretentiousness are pretentious.</p>
    
            “Fair. We endure through it though. Well, we should, at least. My point is wax poetic is lame. Wax eloquent, wax
            lyrical, boo. Just talk about poetry. Talk gooder.”
    
            <p class="p4">Talk gooder.</p>
    
            “Talk betterest.”
    
            <p class="p4">You laughed, infectiously.</p><br><Br>
    
            <p class="p5">You didn’t talk like that. I don’t have your voice saved.</p>
            <p class="p5">I'm tracing a sketch of a sketch of a Picasso. You
                wanted to be a curator. </p>
            <p class="p5">I’m pretentious. Making you seem pretentious.</p>
    
            <p class="p5">Maybe you didn't even really like me.</p>
    
            <p class="p5">Maybe it was a CU Boulder hoodie.</p>
    
            <p class="p5">But I'm good now. Ready.</p>
            <p class="p5">To keep you with me and leave you behind.</p>
    
            <p class="p5">To share bits of you.</p>
            <p class="p5">At least what I’ve got of you to share.</p><br>
    
            <p>The rest was just for us anyway.</p> <br><br><br>
